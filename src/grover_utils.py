def construct_oracle():
    """Constructs a simple oracle for a 2x2 Sudoku puzzle.
    
    The oracle is a quantum circuit that enforces certain constraints 
    for solving the Sudoku puzzle. For a 2x2 Sudoku, we ensure that:
    - Qubit 0 and Qubit 1 must represent different values.
    - Qubit 2 and Qubit 3 must also represent different values.
    
    The oracle is constructed using controlled-Z (CZ) gates, which will flip 
    the phase of the state if both qubits involved are in the |1‚ü© state. 
    This enforces the condition that the values represented by these qubits 
    cannot be the same.

    Returns:
        QuantumCircuit: A quantum circuit representing the oracle.

def diffusion_operator(num_qubits):
    """Creates the diffusion operator used in Grover's algorithm.
    
    The diffusion operator is responsible for amplifying the probability 
    of measuring valid solutions. It works by reflecting the state around 
    the average amplitude, which increases the chances of measuring the 
    correct solutions in the final step of Grover's algorithm.

    The steps involved in creating the diffusion operator are:
    1. Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits, putting them into a superposition.
    2. Apply X gates to all qubits, which inverts the states.
    3. Apply a Hadamard gate to the last qubit.
    4. Use a multi-controlled NOT (MCX) gate to create the reflection.
    5. Apply a Hadamard gate to the last qubit again.
    6. Apply X gates again to all qubits.
    7. Apply Hadamard gates to all qubits to complete the diffusion process.

        num_qubits (int): The number of qubits in the circuit.
